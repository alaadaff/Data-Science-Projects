# Weekend Movie Trip

The aim of this assignment is to build a cluster model in order to assist users with movie recommendations given their movie ratings. Our approach uses a combination of K-Means clustering and massive clustering to make movie recommendations based on how the users rated other movies. We also clusetered the data based on how the users rated specific movie genres.

The dataset used was downloaded from: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/
In specifc the dataset contained almost 10,000 instances of movies, tags and their ratings. They can be found at the links.cs, tags.csv, ratings.csv and movies.csv.
